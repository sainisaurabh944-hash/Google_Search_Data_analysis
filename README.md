## 🧩 Project Overview

In this project, we analyze real-time **Google Trends** data to uncover how global interest in different technologies has evolved over time.

By using Python libraries like **Pytrends**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**, we extract, visualize, and compare keyword popularity to understand user behavior across countries and time periods.

This analysis provides deep insights into **which technologies are trending globally** and **how their popularity changes** — helping businesses, marketers, and data professionals make data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
1️⃣ **Dynamic Search Setup** — Write a code where you can change just one keyword and search for multiple topics easily.  
2️⃣ **Top 15 Countries** — Identify the countries where the keyword is searched the most and visualize it with bar charts.  
3️⃣ **Global Visualization** — Plot a world map showing which countries have the highest search interest.  
4️⃣ **Trend Over Time** — Extract time-wise data to see how interest has changed in different months or years.  
5️⃣ **Keyword Comparison** — Compare multiple related keywords and visualize their popularity over time.

## 🧱 Project Workflow

### 🔹 1. Data Extraction  
~~~
Connect to the Google Trends API using `Pytrends` and extract interest data for a given keyword.
~~~
### 🔹 2. Country-wise Interest  
~~~
Identify the **top 15 countries** with the highest search interest for the keyword and plot it using Seaborn bar plots.
~~~
### 🔹 3. World Map Visualization 🌍 
~~~
Use Plotly’s `choropleth` to build an interactive **world map** showing country-level search interest.
~~~
### 🔹 4. Time-wise Analysis ⏳
~~~
Visualize how the keyword’s popularity changed over the last 12 months with a line chart using Matplotlib.
~~~
### 🔹 5. Keyword Comparison ⚔️
~~~
Analyze and compare multiple keywords (e.g., *Artificial Intelligence*, *Data Science*, *Machine Learning*) on one graph to understand their relative trends.
~~~


## 📈 Visual Insights
~~~
- **Top 15 Countries** — Quickly see which regions search most for your keyword.  
- **Interactive World Map** — Visualize the global popularity in shades of blue.  
- **Time Series Graph** — Understand when searches peaked or dropped.  
- **Keyword Comparison** — Identify which topic dominates user interest over time.

## 🌟 Storytelling — Project Motivation

“In today’s data-driven world, every click and search tells a story.
As a data analyst, I wanted to understand — what does the world care about the most?
Using Google Trends, I built a system that analyzes real-time search data from across the globe.
From Artificial Intelligence to Machine Learning, this project reveals the rise and fall of tech trends over time.”

This project showcases my ability to:
~~~
Work with real-world APIs

Handle rate limiting and exceptions

Create interactive and static visualizations

Tell a story with data 💬
