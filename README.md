# 🧠 Google Search Data Analysis using Python
### 📊 Explore what the world is searching for with Google Trends data

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
In this project, we analyze real-time **Google Trends** data to uncover how global interest in different technologies has evolved over time.

By using Python libraries like **Pytrends**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**, we extract, visualize, and compare keyword popularity to understand user behavior across countries and time periods.

This analysis provides deep insights into **which technologies are trending globally** and **how their popularity changes** — helping businesses, marketers, and data professionals make data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
1️⃣ **Dynamic Search Setup** — Write a code where you can change just one keyword and search for multiple topics easily.  
2️⃣ **Top 15 Countries** — Identify the countries where the keyword is searched the most and visualize it with bar charts.  
3️⃣ **Global Visualization** — Plot a world map showing which countries have the highest search interest.  
4️⃣ **Trend Over Time** — Extract time-wise data to see how interest has changed in different months or years.  
5️⃣ **Keyword Comparison** — Compare multiple related keywords and visualize their popularity over time.

## 🧱 Project Workflow

### 🔹 1. Data Extraction  
Connect to the Google Trends API using `Pytrends` and extract interest data for a given keyword.

### 🔹 2. Country-wise Interest  
Identify the **top 15 countries** with the highest search interest for the keyword and plot it using Seaborn bar plots.

### 🔹 3. World Map Visualization 🌍  
Use Plotly’s `choropleth` to build an interactive **world map** showing country-level search interest.

### 🔹 4. Time-wise Analysis ⏳  
Visualize how the keyword’s popularity changed over the last 12 months with a line chart using Matplotlib.

### 🔹 5. Keyword Comparison ⚔️  
Analyze and compare multiple keywords (e.g., *Artificial Intelligence*, *Data Science*, *Machine Learning*) on one graph to understand their relative trends.
